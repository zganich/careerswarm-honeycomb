# Manus – single copy-paste source

Use **one** of these; both have the same content:

1. **`MANUS_UPDATE.md`** (project root) – open it and copy **everything below the line** into a new Manus task.
2. **`.cursor/commands/copy-paste-prompt-for-manus.md`** – open it and copy **everything below the line** into a new Manus task.

No need to open the handoff first for the prompt; the copy-paste text tells Manus to read `CLAUDE_MANUS_HANDOFF.md` after connecting to the repo.

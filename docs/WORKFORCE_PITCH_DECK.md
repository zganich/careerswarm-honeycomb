## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### Job Seekers Are Stuck in 2010

**Current reality:**
- 4+ hours to customize one application
- Copy-paste resumes that don't pass ATS
- Overwhelmed staff can't help everyone
- Long time-to-reemployment = higher costs

**Your job seekers deserve better tools.**

---

## SLIDE 3: The Cost of Slow Reemployment

### Every Extra Week Unemployed Costs Everyone

| Who Pays | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Job seeker** | Lost wages, stress, skill decay |
| **State** | UI benefits (~$400/week avg) |
| **Workforce board** | Lower placement rates, more touches |
| **Economy** | Reduced consumer spending |

**Faster placement = savings across the board.**

## TALKING POINTS FOR THE MEETING

### If they ask about cost:
"$15,000 for a 90-day pilot with 50-100 job seekers. That's $150-300 per person for 3 months of unlimited applications. Compare that to traditional outplacement at $3,000+ per person."

### If they ask about integration:
"For a pilot, no integration needed. We handle everything. For a larger contract, we can discuss API integrations with your existing systems."

### If they ask about evidence:
"That's exactly why we're proposing a pilot — to generate evidence specific to your population. We'll measure time-to-first-application, application volume, and placement rate together."

### If they're hesitant:
"What would make you comfortable moving forward? Is it seeing a demo? Talking to a reference? A smaller pilot? We're flexible."

### Close:
"Who else should be in the room for a demo? Can we schedule 30 minutes next week?"

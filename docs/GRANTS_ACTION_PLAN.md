## 🥇 #1 PRIORITY: Local Workforce Board Pilot

### Why This First
- **Money exists now** — Workforce boards have discretionary/innovation funds
- **Decision makers are local** — You can meet them in person
- **Small pilots = fast approval** — $10K-$50K doesn't need federal approval
- **Success here → bigger contracts** — Proof point for state/federal

### Your Utah Workforce Boards

| Region | Board/Center | Covers | Contact Point |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| **Salt Lake** | Salt Lake County Workforce Services | Salt Lake County | jobs.utah.gov/saltlake |
| **Utah County** | Utah County Workforce Services | Provo, Orem area | jobs.utah.gov/utahcounty |
| **Davis** | Davis County Workforce Services | Davis County | jobs.utah.gov/davis |
| **Weber** | Weber/Morgan Workforce Services | Ogden area | jobs.utah.gov/weber |
| **Wasatch Front** | Wasatch Front South | South of SLC | jobs.utah.gov |
| **Mountainland** | Mountainland Region | Utah, Wasatch, Summit | mountainland.org |

**Utah State Contact:**
- **Department of Workforce Services (DWS):** jobs.utah.gov
- **Workforce Development Division:** They administer WIOA funds statewide
- **Contact for innovation/pilots:** workforce@utah.gov (or find the Business Services lead)

**Utah Advantage:** Utah has a strong state workforce system — DWS is well-organized and innovation-friendly. Start with Salt Lake County (biggest volume) or pitch at the state level.

### Action Plan (Weeks 1-4)

**Week 1: Research & Prep**
- [ ] Identify 3 closest workforce boards to you
- [ ] Find their "Business Services" or "Innovation" contact
- [ ] Research their current challenges (Google "[board name] annual report")
- [ ] Prepare 1-page pitch (see below)

**Week 2: Outreach**
- [ ] Email 3 boards requesting 15-min intro call
- [ ] Follow up with phone calls
- [ ] Attend any public board meetings (often monthly, public)

**Week 3-4: Pitch & Pilot Design**
- [ ] Present demo of CareerSwarm
- [ ] Propose pilot: 50-100 job seekers, 90 days, measure outcomes
- [ ] Negotiate pilot fee ($10K-$25K) or grant allocation

### What They Care About
```
✓ Time to reemployment (reduce from 90 days to ?)
✓ Applications submitted per job seeker
✓ Placement rate
✓ Cost per placement
✓ Employer satisfaction with candidates
✓ UI duration reduction (saves state money)
```

### The Pitch (1-Pager)

**Problem:** Job seekers spend 4+ hours per application. Your staff is overwhelmed helping them write resumes and cover letters. Application volume is down, time-to-placement is up.

**Solution:** CareerSwarm — AI career infrastructure that:
- Creates a Master Profile from their resume (once)
- Generates tailored resumes + cover letters for each job (minutes)
- Tracks all applications in one place
- Works 24/7 (supplements your staff, doesn't replace them)

**Pilot Proposal:**
- 50-100 job seekers for 90 days
- You provide: referrals, feedback
- We provide: full access, onboarding, support
- We measure: applications submitted, time-to-placement, satisfaction
- Investment: $15,000 (or allocate from existing discretionary/innovation funds)

**Why Now:** Job seekers expect AI-powered tools. First workforce board to offer this = competitive advantage.

## 🥈 #2 PRIORITY: Corporate Outplacement

### Why This is a Quick Win
- **Companies pay immediately** — No grant cycle, just a contract
- **Trigger events are constant** — Layoffs happen weekly
- **Per-employee pricing** — $50-$500/person is typical
- **Builds case studies** — "We helped 200 TechCorp employees..."

### Target Companies
- Any company announcing layoffs (track via layoffs.fyi, LinkedIn, news)
- HR consulting firms that provide outplacement
- Staffing agencies with outplacement services

### Pricing Model
| Package | Price | Includes |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Basic** | $99/employee | 3 months Pro access |
| **Standard** | $199/employee | 6 months + onboarding webinar |
| **Premium** | $499/employee | 12 months + 1:1 setup + priority support |

### Action Plan (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Create outplacement landing page (/enterprise or /outplacement)
- [ ] Draft outreach email for HR leaders
- [ ] Monitor layoffs.fyi for recent announcements
- [ ] Reach out to 10 companies within 48 hours of announcement
- [ ] Partner with 1-2 HR consultants who do outplacement

---

## 🥉 #3 PRIORITY: Community College Partnership

### Why This Works
- Colleges have **Perkins V** and **WIOA** funds for career services
- Career centers are understaffed
- Students + adult learners need job search help
- **Pilot can be small** — One department, one semester

### Target Colleges (Utah)
- **Salt Lake Community College (SLCC)** — Largest in state, multiple campuses
- **Utah Valley University (UVU)** — Big career services, Orem
- **Weber State University** — Ogden area
- **Dixie State / Utah Tech** — St. George
- **Snow College** — Ephraim/Richfield

**Best bet:** Start with **SLCC** — they're huge, have strong workforce programs, and are in your backyard.

### Pitch Angle
"Supplement your career center with AI — students get 24/7 resume and application help, your staff handles coaching and employer relationships."

### Action Plan (Weeks 2-6)
- [ ] Identify Career Services director at 3 colleges
- [ ] Email with case for pilot (free or low-cost first semester)
- [ ] Offer to present at career services staff meeting
- [ ] Propose per-student pricing ($10-$25/student/semester at scale)

## 🏆 #4: State RESEA Contract (Bigger, Slower)

### What is RESEA?
- **Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment**
- Federal program, administered by states
- Serves Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants
- Requires them to engage with reemployment services
- States contract with providers to deliver these services

### Why It's Valuable
- **Steady volume** — Thousands of UI claimants
- **Recurring contract** — Multi-year agreements
- **State pays** — Not dependent on individual sales

### Utah RESEA
- Administered by **Utah Department of Workforce Services (DWS)**
- Utah runs RESEA through their employment centers statewide
- Current providers: DWS centers + some contracted providers
- Contact: DWS Unemployment Insurance division or Workforce Development
- Website: jobs.utah.gov

**Utah note:** DWS is centralized (unlike some states with fragmented boards). This can be good — one relationship at state level can unlock statewide access.

### What You'd Need to Build
- [ ] Reporting dashboard (outcomes by claimant)
- [ ] Integration with state systems (may require API)
- [ ] Compliance documentation
- [ ] Staff for support/account management

### Action Plan (Months 1-6)
- [ ] Research current RESEA providers in Colorado
- [ ] Contact CDLE to understand procurement process
- [ ] Start as subcontractor to existing provider (faster)
- [ ] Build toward direct contract in Year 2

2. **Next week:** Build basic admin dashboard (user count, app count).
3. **Week 3-4:** Close a $10K-$25K pilot.
4. **Month 2:** Deliver results, collect data.
5. **Month 3:** Use data to pursue bigger contracts (state, foundation).

The fastest money is **local workforce boards** and **corporate outplacement**. Everything else builds on having proof that it works.

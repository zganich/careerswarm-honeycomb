# OpenClaw handoff

When an OpenClaw agent finishes work and hands off, it can append a short summary here so you or Cursor can review and commit without re-reading the chat.

**Format (agent fills in):**

- **When:** date/time
- **Agent:** ship | server | client | docs | main
- **What ran:** e.g. ship:check:full, monitor, server sweep
- **What failed (if any):** brief
- **What changed:** files and summary of edits
- **Ready for:** review and commit (or: needs env / human decision)

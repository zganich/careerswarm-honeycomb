Subject: Database Recreation Request - Project zfvp3dr5t953xyc34e9psq

Hi Manus Support,

I accidentally dropped the database for project "careerswarm" (ID: zfvp3dr5t953xyc34e9psq) 
while following deployment instructions. The database was managed by TiDB Cloud and I cannot 
recreate it via SQL commands.

Could you please recreate the database with the name: ZfVp3DR5T953XYC34e9PSQ

Once recreated, I will run the migrations to create the tables.

Thank you!
```

## ✅ After Database is Recreated

Run these commands in order:

### 1. Verify Database Exists
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/careerswarm
node -e "
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const url = process.env.DATABASE_URL.replace(/\/[^\/]+\?/, '/?');
mysql.createConnection(url).then(async conn => {
  const [dbs] = await conn.query('SHOW DATABASES');
  console.log('Available databases:');
  dbs.forEach(db => console.log('  -', db.Database));
  await conn.end();
}).catch(console.error);
"
```
**Expected:** Should show `ZfVp3DR5T953XYC34e9PSQ` in the list

---

### 2. Run Migrations
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/careerswarm
pnpm db:migrate
```
**Expected:** "Migrations complete" message, no errors

---

### 3. Verify Tables Created
```bash
node -e "
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL).then(async conn => {
  const [tables] = await conn.query('SHOW TABLES');
  console.log('Total tables:', tables.length);
  console.log('Tables:', tables.map(t => Object.values(t)[0]).join(', '));
  await conn.end();
}).catch(console.error);
"
```
**Expected:** 30+ tables including users, userProfiles, workExperiences, achievements, skills, etc.

---

### 4. Continue Deployment

Follow remaining steps from MANUS_PROMPT.md:

```bash
# Step 5: Verify environment
pnpm run verify-env

# Step 6: Build
pnpm run build

# Step 7: Run
pnpm start
```

---

### 5. Test Onboarding Flow

1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Sign in with Dev Login: `test@careerswarm.com`
3. Complete onboarding steps 1-5
4. Verify data saves to database
5. Check profile page shows data (NOT "No profile found")

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

- ✅ Database `ZfVp3DR5T953XYC34e9PSQ` exists
- ✅ `pnpm db:migrate` completes without errors
- ✅ 30+ tables created
- ✅ Onboarding flow saves data
- ✅ Profile page shows Master Profile (not "No profile found")
- ✅ No database connection errors in logs

---

## 💡 Key Lesson

**Never drop managed databases without a recreation plan.**

For future schema resets, use:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push --force
```
This resets tables without dropping the database.

**Next Action:** Submit support ticket at https://help.manus.im  
**Blocker:** Database recreation  
**ETA:** Depends on Manus support response time

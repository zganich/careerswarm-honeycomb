## Context

James is building **CareerSwarm** — an AI-powered career infrastructure platform that helps job seekers apply to jobs faster with tailored resumes and cover letters.

**Current focus (Feb 2026):**
- Getting to first revenue (B2C Pro tier + B2B outplacement)
- Pursuing workforce development grants and pilots
- Targeting Utah workforce boards, community colleges, and corporate outplacement
- Shoestring budget — minimal spend, no new infra

**Priorities:**

2. Wire Stripe for Pro ($29/mo)
3. Land first workforce pilot ($10-25K)
4. Corporate outplacement deals

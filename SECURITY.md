# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We release security updates for the **current major version** (see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)). Upgrade to the latest release to receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

- **Preferred:** In this repo, open the **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** (private report), if enabled.
- **Otherwise:** Contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via the contact method listed in the repo or your existing channel). Include a short description, steps to reproduce, and impact.

We will acknowledge receipt, work on a fix, and coordinate disclosure with you. Thank you for helping keep CareerSwarm safe.
